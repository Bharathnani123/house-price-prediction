# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project builds a **regression model** to predict California housing prices using real-world housing data.  
It compares **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** models for accurate predictions.

## 📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict **median house prices** based on several features such as:
- Median income
- Average number of rooms
- Average number of bedrooms
- Population
- Proximity to ocean, etc.

The dataset used is the **California Housing dataset** from Scikit-learn.
